# PoneNgine Server

_We will not start this server project until the main game engine's core is complete and working._

Server side core for the PoneNgine game engine, clientside networking code can be seen at the main project inside it's Networking folder [here](https://github.com/TheWapaCastleTeam/PoneNgine).

## Features that We Plan to Do

* This project will use Qt's Networking libraries, but we will also add the choice for the use another networking library that is RakNet.
* PoneNgine Servers will mainly support MySQL Databases, but we may support other SQL systems.
* Add integration to websites so if a gaming community runs a server of a PoneNgine powered game, they can show it's data on their website, or even manipulate the server from a web based control panel.
